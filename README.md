## üìñ Project Overview

For centuries, medicinal plants have been a cornerstone of natural remedies and traditional medicine. However, accurately identifying different species can be challenging for non-experts, and even botanists can benefit from technological assistance.

This project introduces an intelligent system powered by **YOLOv8** to **detect and classify medicinal plants**. The model is trained on a custom dataset and is capable of identifying the specified plant species with high precision. This serves as a foundational step towards building accessible tools for researchers, enthusiasts, and practitioners in the field of herbal medicine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the pre-trained model to perform inference.

### Run the Model on Test Images
Execute the following command to run the detection script. This will load the trained weights and process the test images.
```bash
python "Trained model/yolov8n-medicinal-plants/Model implementation.py"
```
The script will save the output images with bounding boxes drawn around the detected medicinal plants.
